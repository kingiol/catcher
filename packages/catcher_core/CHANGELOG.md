## 0.3.19

### Bug Fixes

- Preserve structured transport failure details through NAPI HTTP retries, including error codes and chained causes, so host applications can diagnose connection failures after retries are exhausted.

### Packaging

- Synchronize the Flutter package version with the unified Catcher `0.3.19` release; the Dart API surface is otherwise unchanged.

## 0.3.18

### Bug Fixes

- **HTTP 421 recovery**: native HTTP requests rebuild the current transport's connection pool and retry once after a `421 Misdirected Request`, without cancelling unrelated in-flight requests.
- **Structured NAPI HTTP errors**: the Node.js NAPI wrapper exports `HttpError` with `status`, `body`, and `cause` fields so host applications can inspect HTTP status failures directly.

### Packaging

- Synchronize all Catcher package versions to `0.3.18`; the Flutter API surface is otherwise unchanged.

## 0.3.17

### Bug Fixes

- **Flutter WebSocket direct connections**: default simple WebSocket connections now use the yawc native backend, restoring Android Flutter socket connectivity while keeping reqwest for proxy, Catcher DNS, and advanced TLS configurations.
- **WebSocket network change recovery**: `networkChanged()` immediately reconnects, resets reconnect backoff, re-races all endpoints for multi-endpoint configs, and replays buffered send commands after reconnect.
- **WebSocket old native library compatibility**: missing `catcher_ws_network_changed` is handled lazily so older native libraries can still construct clients; calling `networkChanged()` reports a clear rebuild requirement.
- **Apple framework metadata**: generated iOS/macOS `catcher_ffi.xcframework` bundles include minimum OS metadata, and podspec versions are synchronized for this release.

### Behavior Changes

- **Rust `EndpointRacer` internalized**: multi-endpoint racing is now an implementation detail of `WsTransport::connect()` and is no longer exposed as `catcher_ws::EndpointRacer`. Configure `WsClientConfig.urls` / `race_count` instead.

## 0.3.16

### Bug Fixes

- **napi `system-proxy` feature not enabled**: 0.3.15 introduced system proxy
  auto-detection (`proxy.mode = "system"`), but both napi bindings
  (`catcher-napi-http`, `catcher-napi-ws`) did not enable the `system-proxy` cargo
  feature on their dependency, so `detect_system_proxy()` compiled to a no-op stub
  and `proxy.mode = "system"` silently did nothing in the published npm packages.
  The feature is now enabled on both napi crates.
- **napi TypeScript types synced**: `ProxyConfig` is now modeled as a discriminated
  union in the published TS types — `ManualProxyConfig` (default) requires `url`,
  `SystemProxyConfig` (`mode: 'system'`) may omit it. This tightens the types so
  url-less manual configs (which would panic in `transport_url()`) no longer
  type-check. The Dart package is unaffected (no napi binding).

## 0.3.15

### Features

- **`ProxyMode` enum** (`Manual` / `System`): caller can set `proxy.mode = "system"` to
  let catcher auto-detect the system proxy from the OS instead of passing a URL manually.
- **System proxy auto-detection** via `proxy-cfg`: macOS (SystemConfiguration), Windows
  (WinINET registry + WinHTTP), Linux (env vars + /etc/sysconfig/proxy).
- **`networkChanged()` re-detects system proxy**: when the network environment changes,
  system proxy is re-read and the reqwest client is rebuilt if the proxy address changed.

### ⚠️

- **`ProxyConfig.url`: `String` → `Option<String>`**: a pre-1.0 breaking change. JSON
  deserialization is backward-compatible (`#[serde(default)]` ensures `mode` defaults
  to `Manual` when absent).

## 0.3.13

### Behavior Changes

- DNS is now opt-in: without a `dns` config the platform's native resolver is used
  (previously the Catcher resolver was always built). Pass `dns` to re-enable
  caching / host mapping / custom nameservers.
- `socks5://` proxies are normalized to `socks5h://` so the target domain is
  resolved remotely at the proxy (fixes Clash / VPN domain routing).
- `tls_sni_override` is rejected on the native transport (was silently ignored).

### Bug Fixes

- FFI lifecycle: destroying a client now stops in-flight requests/SSE and no longer
  invokes the host callback afterwards (prevents use-after-free).

## 0.3.12

### Packaging

- Add `MinimumOSVersion` 15.0 to the bundled iOS `catcher_ffi.framework` Info.plist for App Store upload validation.
- Rebuild the bundled Apple native frameworks.

## 0.3.11

### New features

- Update the native WebSocket transport to use `yawc`, enabling native permessage-deflate (RFC 7692) support in the bundled Rust implementation.
- Add `application_compression` config to `WsClientConfig` with gzip and zstd support for application-layer compression fallback.

### Fixes

- Improve Android native build reliability by exporting NDK `CC_*` and `AR_*` variables for cross-compiled native dependencies.
- Buffer and replay messages sent during WebSocket reconnection instead of silently dropping them.
- Add fast pong timeout detection within a single heartbeat cycle.
- Echo Close frames on receipt before disconnecting (RFC 6455 §5.5.1).
- Report actual reconnect latency in `Connected` events instead of 0 ms.
- Remove `native-tls` feature; TLS is handled entirely by `yawc/rustls-ring`.

### Packaging

- Refresh bundled native Rust dependency versions for the 0.3.11 release.

## 0.3.10

### Packaging

- Bump the Flutter package to `0.3.10` to keep it aligned with the fresh npm and Rust release.
- Rebuild the native bundles through the full release workflow.

## 0.3.9

### New features

- Add native DNS cache controls to `DnsConfig`: `cacheSize`, `negativeTtlSecs`, `staleTtlSecs`, and `staleOnError`.
- Add `msgpack` to `HttpClientConfig` for native HTTP JSON ↔ MessagePack body conversion.
- Add `dns` and `msgpack` to `WsClientConfig` so Flutter WebSocket clients can use DNS cache settings and native MessagePack conversion.

### Fixes

- Fix DNS config not being passed through the Dart FFI layer to the native HTTP and WebSocket clients.
- Fix built-in MessagePack config not being passed through the Dart FFI layer.

### Packaging

- Keep bundled Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows native libraries below pub.dev package size limits.

## 0.3.8

- Publish `catcher_core` as a Flutter FFI plugin with platform native bundle metadata.
- Bundle prebuilt Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows native libraries during pub.dev release.
- Refresh README installation guidance for the current package version.

## 0.3.1

- Package `catcher_core` as a Flutter FFI plugin with platform native bundle metadata.
- Bundle prebuilt Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, and Windows native libraries during pub.dev release.
- Load Apple builds from `catcher_ffi.framework/catcher_ffi` and desktop/mobile dynamic libraries from app bundle search paths.

## 0.2.2

- SSE client: `CatcherSseClient` (persistent + auto-reconnect) and `sseStream()` (one-shot).
- Per-request headers + timeout in `get()`, `post()`, `sseStream()`.
- `cancelAll()`, `circuitBreakerState`, `metrics`, `setAdaptiveTimeout()`.
- Full config passthrough: `TlsConfig`, `DnsConfig`, `ProxyConfig`, `RedirectConfig`.
- `WsClientConfig` now includes `headers`, `protocols`, `deflateThresholdBytes`, `raceCount`.
- `qualityHistory()` for persistent sliding window network quality data.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release.
- HTTP client with retries, timeouts, keep-alive.
- WebSocket client with reconnection and permessage-deflate.
- FFI bindings to Rust core.
